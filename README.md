# covariate-selection-hidden-factor-rnaseq
The FSRnSimBS_sva function integrates variable selection (FSR) with surrogate variable analysis (SVA), incorporating three approaches: FSR_sva (combined FSR-SVA), SVAall_FSR (combined SVA_FSR), and SVA0 (surrogate variable estimation using primary variable only). Performance is evaluated across 100 replications using two metric categories: (1) variable selection (average false selection rate, FSR; number of relevant covariates, R) and (2) differential expression analysis (empirical FDR; average true positives, NTP; partial AUC, PAUC).
