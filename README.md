# covariate-selection-hidden-factor-rnaseq
The FSRnSimBS_sva function integrates variable selection with surrogate variable analysis (SVA), combining the FSR_sva and SVAall_FSR strategies alongside the SVA0 approach which calculates surrogate variable solely based on the primary variable of interest. It estimates three sets of surrogate variables and evaluates performance using metrics for both variable selection (average false selection rate, FSR and number of relevant covariates, R) and differential expression analysis (empirical false discovery rate, FDR; average true positives, NTP; and partial AUC, PAUC), all computed over 100 replications.
