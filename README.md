# covariate-selection-hidden-factor-rnaseq
The `FSR1SimBS_sva_ruv` function performs variable selection along with the surrogate variable analysis. The two combined strategies considerded in the function are FSR_sva and SVAall_FSR along with the surrogate variable analysis only with the primary variable(SVA0). This function returns 3 sets of estimated surrogate variables and the evaluation matrices of differentially express analysis include FSR, S, R, FDR, NTP and PAUC.  For variable selection, the function estimates the average false selection rate(FSR) and the average number of selected relevant covariates (R) over these 100 replications. For the analysis of differential expression, the function computes empirical false discovery rate (FDR), the average number of true positives (NTP), and the average partial area under the ROC curve (PAUC) across the same 100 replications.
